           INDIA AND ASEAN: POTENTIAL ITEMS OF ENGINEERING TRADE


        ASEAN as a region is the third-largest export destination of Indian engineering products after EU and North America.
        Among the ASEAN member nations, Singapore and Malaysia are the fourth- and sixth-largest destinations for Indian
        engineering products. Comprehensive scope for further expansion of bilateral trade is still left as engineering trade is far
        from reaching its full potential. India’s trade complementarity index has been found at over 50 with most of the ASEAN
        nations, which is reflective of a high match in India’s export pattern of engineering goods to ASEAN’s import pattern of
        those goods.]]></page><page Index="29"><![CDATA[The table shows potential engineering products for enhancing bilateral trade in engineering.

                                  India-ASEAN Strategic Relations








          1.1 INTRODUCTION



        The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, popularly known by its acronym, ASEAN, is an economic union in Southeast
        Asia comprising 10 member-states, namely, Brunei, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore,
        Thailand, and Vietnam. Over the years, this regional entity has become increasingly prominent due to its geopolitical
        importance and economic structure. India, as a part of its strategy to exploit opportunities in emerging Asia and Africa,
        has been emphasising on building multidimensional relationships with ASEAN since its very independence.


























          1.2  DIFFERENT PHASES OF INDIA-ASEAN RELATIONSHIP


        The evolution of the India-ASEAN relationship can be categorised into five distinct phases:

             1.  Pre-colonial era: Predominance of socio-cultural and mercantile ties

             2.  Colonial era: Disruption of cultural and trade links
             3.  Post-independence: Re-establishment of links with increasing importance

             4.  Look East Policy (LEP): Reinvigorating the partnership with deeper commercial and strategic ties

             5.  Launching of Act East Policy (AEP): More inclusive relationship towards building a strong regional network]]></page><page Index="32"><![CDATA[30








        This chapter will discuss the transformation of the India-ASEAN relationship from the informal socio-cultural ties in
        the pre-colonial era to the more inclusive bilateral relations of today, encompassing all aspects of social, political, and
        economic affairs.


         1.2.1 Pre-colonial era: Predominance of socio-cultural and mercantile ties


        The initial links between India and the Southeast Asian region were basically socio-cultural with the spread of Hinduism
        and Buddhism in these regions in the pre-colonial era. Mercantile links were very much an active component of the
        relationship that formed the basis of carrying the relationship further.


         1.2.2  Colonial era: Disruption of cultural and trade links


        India’s  ties  with  the  Southeast Asian  region  that  developed  and  grew in  the  pre-colonial  era, lost  pace  with  the
        establishment of British colonial rule in the subcontinent. The social, cultural, trade, and maritime links that India had
        developed with the Southeast Asian region over long years were totally disrupted during the British rule.


         1.2.3 Post-independence: Re-establishment of links with increasing importance


        After India gained independence in 1947, the country took various initiatives with a view to restore relationships with
        different regions of the world and move towards regional integration among newly-independent countries in the Asian
        and African regions. However, due to geopolitical disorders such as the Indo-China war and the Cold War, bilateral
        relations could not firm up to the expected levels despite the formation of ASEAN in 1967.


         1.2.4 Look East Policy: Towards a dynamic relationship

        India started opening up its economy through a series of economic reforms in the early 1990s with the formulation
        of the New Economic Policy (NEP). Then India officially launched its Look East Policy (LEP) in line with the objectives
        of NEP and, with the implementation of the policy, the importance of the ASEAN region for India as a corridor to reach
        Southeast Asia increased significantly. The LEP made the relationship dynamic in the true sense by leading India to
        become a Sectoral Partner of ASEAN in 1992, a Dialogue Partner in 1996, and a Summit-level Partner in 2002.

        The relationship was further reinvigorated with the signing of a Free Trade Agreement in Goods between India and
        ASEAN in 2009 and then again in 2012 when India and ASEAN became Strategic Partners.

        The purpose of LEP was essentially to strengthen India’s economic relations with Southeast Asia with the aim of
        diversifying trade and moving away from its major trading partners, North America and Europe. On the other hand,
        ASEAN member-nations also saw India as an option to reduce their economic dependence on China, Japan, and the
        Western nations. LEP was considered a turning point in reinvigorating India’s partnership with the Southeast Asian
        region.]]></page><page Index="33"><![CDATA[Chapter 1








         1.2.5  Act East Policy: A more inclusive approach


        After the present government came to power in India under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, policy
        formulation went in for a major overhaul and LEP was replaced by a more inclusive Act East Policy (AEP). The India-
        ASEAN Strategic Partnership acquired a new dimension with the announcement of the Act East Policy in the 12th
        India-ASEAN Summit in 2014 with a clear intent on the part of India to up-scaling its engagement with the ASEAN. In
        fact, AEP could well be considered as a facelift of LEP. While LEP concentrated primarily on trade and economy, AEP
        was more multidimensional in nature, encompassing political security, connectivity, and social and cultural issues along
        with trade and economic affairs as the focus areas of action for a greater ASEAN-India integration. The India-ASEAN
        Trade-in-Services and Investment Agreement signed in 2014 came into effect in 2015.

        Implementation of the FTAs in 2010 and 2015, building a strategic partnership, and multidirectional approach of the
        AEP has made the India-ASEAN relationship dynamic as well as vibrant of late. The AEP emphasised strengthening the
        cooperation with extended neighbours and stronger relations with the big powers by keeping ASEAN as the region of
        core interest.



          1.3  25 YEARS OF ASEAN-INDIA DIALOGUE PARTNERSHIP



        In 2017, India and ASEAN celebrated 25 years of their Dialogue Partnership, 15 years of Summit-level interaction, and
        five years of Strategic Partnership both in India and in ASEAN member-states. The celebrations involved conducting
        key activities in various sectors of bilateral engagement to highlight the strengths of the relationship. The activities
        included ASEAN-India Ministerial/Business Meet in the Telecom sector on the sidelines of the Telecom Expo; 6th Global
        Economic Summit with special session on Women Entrepreneurs in ASEAN; Act East Dialogue; Kolkata Dialogue;
        Northeast Business Summit with focus on Connectivity with ASEAN; ASEAN-India Biztech Conference in Kuala Lumpur;
        and ASEAN-India Roundtable – 25 years of Partnership. By 2017, there were 30 annual institutional mechanisms for
        dialogue between India and ASEAN.]]></page><page Index="34"><![CDATA[32









          1.4  CURRENT STATUS: TOWARDS A MORE VIBRANT RELATIONSHIP



          1.4.1 Connectivity
        Strengthening  regional  connectivity  network,  including  land  and  sea  connectivity,  with ASEAN  is  one  of  the  key
        strategic objectives of the India-ASEAN relationship. The signal effort under the ASEAN-India Connectivity initiative is
        the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway. The India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Task Force on Connectivity and
        Infrastructure has been set-up to take up time-bound work on completion of the Trilateral Highway and also undertake
        negotiations on the Motor Vehicles Agreement. India and ASEAN are holding consultations on extension of the Trilateral
        Highway to Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. India and ASEAN are also working to strengthen Maritime Connectivity.


          1.4.2  Economic cooperation

        Discussions on economic or commercial relations between India and the ASEAN are limited by the scope of this chapter.
        However, the very next chapter will present a detailed analytical discussion on development of trade and investment
        relations between India and ASEAN over the years.



          1.4.3  17th ASEAN-India Summit, 2020


        The centrality of ASEAN in India’s Act East Policy was underlined by the Indian Prime Minister who also underscored
        the importance of strengthening convergence between India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and the ASEAN Outlook
        on Indo-Pacific, to ensure a free, open, inclusive and rules-based Indo-Pacific region at the 17th ASEAN India Summit
        in 2020. Major announcements by the Indian Prime Minister was contribution of $1 million to the Covid-19 ASEAN
        Response Fund and extending $1 billion Line of Credit to support ASEAN connectivity.

          1.4.4  China as an economic superpower in ASEAN region

        China’s presence in the ASEAN nations is much wider and more deeply entrenched in comparison to any other nations.
        In fact, it was one of the major driving forces behind all India’s endeavours, though implicit, to enlarge its footsteps in
        this promising region. The trade and investment volumes of China with ASEAN nations are far ahead of other partners
        and China has also built a solid connectivity network to deepen its economic engagement with this region. On the other
        hand, India’s rise as a prominent global power and the rising Chinese engagement in ASEAN tempted ASEAN countries
        to welcome India’s increased presence in the region. Being fully aware of the opportunities offered by ASEAN for Indian
        trade and investments, the LEP and, specifically, the AEP, were well-thought-out, logical, and multifaceted organising
        principles advocated by India to enhance its participation in ASEAN and also to reciprocate to China’s ascendancy in
        the region but without any conflict.]]></page><page Index="35"><![CDATA[Chapter 1









          1.5  WAY FORWARD: PLAN OF ACTION FOR 2021-25



        Over the years, India and ASEAN have become increasingly important to each other and have together been trying
        to set up rules-based order for the region in the Indo-Pacific framework. During the last India-ASEAN Summit in
        November 2020, a new ASEAN-India Plan of Action (PoA) for 2021-2025 was adopted by both the participants. Through
        the implementation of this PoA, ASEAN and India have decided to work towards supporting the ASEAN community-
        building and integration process, building a politically cohesive, economically integrated, socially responsible, and a
        truly people-oriented, people-centred and rules-based ASEAN, narrowing the development gap and enhancing ASEAN
        connectivity. Both sides will also further promote cooperation in addressing common and emerging challenges and
        enhance coordination in other international fora on issues of common concern to contribute to overall peace, stability
        and prosperity.

              Integrating Engineering RVCs: Role of ASEAN-India FTA









          2.1 INTRODUCTION



        Favourable demographics, rising middle class, growing disposable income, and recent business-friendly policy reforms
        in both South Asia and the ASEAN countries are some of the common factors driving growth in both the regions. This,
        in turn, has created increased trade opportunities for the countries in this region. As the largest economy in South Asia,
        India has witnessed its trade relations with the ASEAN region growing significantly in the last decade. Both India and
        ASEAN are strong emerging economies offering large and diversified markets, and cheap labour and cost of production
        which are creating mutual trade opportunities for the two partners.

        The total trade between India and ASEAN trebled since 2009. India is the 11th-largest export partner for the ASEAN
        region, while the ASEAN region is the fourth-largest trade partner for India. In 2019-20, India’s total trade with the
        ASEAN region was to the tune of $86.9 billion compared to $56.2 billion in 2010-11. Based on their mutual trade
        opportunities, the two partners have pledged to increase their bilateral trade to $300 billion by 2025.


          2.2   ASEAN-INDIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT



          2.2.1 Trade in Goods Agreement

        The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement was signed in 2009 and brought into force in 2010. Under the agreement,
        India and ASEAN decided to progressively eliminate tariffs of 80 percent of the tariff lines accounting for 75 percent
        of the trade. India and all the ASEAN countries have maintained country-wise lists of exclusion from proposed tariff
        concessions or elimination.
        The time period for elimination or reduction of tariffs under the various tariff categories such as normal tracks 1 and 2,
        sensitive track, special products, and highly sensitive track for non-CLMV nations barring Philippines was decided to be
        2019; 2022 for Philippines; and 2024 for Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV). Tariff concessions in the
        agreement are offered either through tariff elimination or tariff reduction. Table2.1 itemises the agreed tariff reduction
        or elimination framework for different categories of tariff lines among the ASEAN member-states and India.]]></page><page Index="37"><![CDATA[Chapter 2

          2.2.2 Trade in Services and Investment Agreement

        The ASEAN-India Trade in Services and Investment Agreement was signed in 2014 and came into effect in 2015.
        While the Services Agreement mainly deals with factors such as transparency, domestic regulations, market access,
        national treatment, dispute settlement, and denial of benefits, the Services Agreement primarily focuses on protection
        of investment and non-discriminatory treatment to ensure fair and equitable service to investors of both countries.


           2.3 IMPACT OF FTA ON MERCHANDISE AND ENGINEERING TRADE



        Since the signing of the FTA, India’s total merchandise exports to the ASEAN increased from $18.1 billion in 2009-10
        to $31.5 billion in 2019-20. On the other hand India’s imports from the ASEAN during the same period increased from
        $25.8 billion to $41.8 billion. From Figure1 it is evident the rate of increase in exports have been higher than that of
        imports. It should be mentioned that India always had a negative trade balance with ASEAN due to its dependency on
        the ASEAN partners for key resources including petroleum oil, palm oil and minerals.

        Investment flow has also substantially grown between the two partners. ASEAN countries accounted for 18.28
        percent of India’s total FDI inflow between 2000 and 2018. During the same period, FDI inflows from ASEAN to India
        were to the tune $68.91 billion. On the other hand, as per DEA, between 2007 and 2015, outflow of investment from
        India to the ASEAN countries was to the tune of $38.67 billion.]]></page><page Index="41"><![CDATA[Chapter 2









          2.4 BUILDING REGIONAL VALUE CHAINS: ROLE OF AIFTA




        In today’s world, global value chains are an important feature of global trade, accounting for 70 percent of its total share.
        GVCs lead to integration of supply chains among nations, resulting in outsourcing and fragmentation of production in
        various locations. Participation in GVCs has a number of benefits including reduced cost of manufacturing and trading
        of participating countries. This is especially true for the developing economies as UNCTAD estimates that value added
        trade in developing countries contribute nearly 30 percent of the country’s GDP while for developed countries it is only
        18 percent. Therefore, GVCs have been the crucial link between trade expansion and development.


        The advent of the Covid19 pandemic, however, has shown us the weakness of a large global value chain. Compared
        to large GVCs, smaller regional value chains (RVCs) have shown better resilience in these difficult times. With UNCTAD
        stating that RVCs are increasingly gaining importance in North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia, it is a clear
        indication that these will continue to persist despite any chances of closing borders due to the pandemic.


        A study by the Exim Bank in 2018 mentioned that while the ASEAN region is one of the highest contributors in the global
        value chains, the participation has not be equal among all ASEAN countries. Compared to Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand,
        and Singapore, its CLMV counterparts have much lower participation in global value chains. India’s participation in
        GVCs is also not very significant. Therefore, there is scope to integrate India’s economy with the CLMV region through
        creation of RVCs. A study conducted by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in 2015 suggested a three-pronged
        strategy for integrating SMEs in India and their CLMV counterparts. These include:


           a. Linking SMEs to large companies in CLMV

           b. Linking SMEs to MNCs in CLMV

           c. Linking SMEs to their counterparts in the CLMV countries


        The study also suggested some potential sectors for creation of RVCs with the CLMV. The potential engineering
        sectors are tabulated in Table2.3.

        Table2.3: Country-wise potential engineering sector for RVCs in CLMV region


            Country               Potential sector
            Cambodia              Electrical and electronic equipment, auto-components, iron and steel and its products
            Lao PDR               Electrical and electronic equipment, iron and steel
            Myanmar               Auto-components, products of iron and steel, electrical and electronic equipment

        The AIFTA has been somewhat successful in creating value chains among India and its ASEAN counterparts, especially
        the CLMV countries, but there is still significant untapped potential.


          2.5 ISSUES AND WAY FORWARD



        The full potential of AIFTA is restricted by several challenges which need to be addressed at the earliest. While relooking
        at the FTA terms is a continuous process between the two partners, this chapter lists some of the challenges and tries
        to suggest the way forward.
            a.    Non-tariff barriers: While the Agreement has been largely effective in reducing tariff barriers in almost 90
                  percent products, several non-tariff barriers in the form of import regulations and other technicalities have
                  limited the scope of trade expansion. The two partners need to set up joint monitoring committees to ensure
                  proper implementation of the FTA and identification of non-tariff barriers. Regarding technical standards and
                  regulations, there should be mutual recognition of institutions and standards.

            b.    High cost of compliance: The cumbersome process and administrative complexities of accessing
                  preferential routes adds to delay and higher compliance cost. This needs to be addressed and compliance cost
                  must be reduced.
            c.    Lack of awareness on preferential routes: In many instances the exporters are not aware of
                  the preferential agreements. The additional high compliance cost deters many to opt for preferential routes.
                  A study by Niti Aayog found that utilisation rate of FTAs in India is very low – ranging over 5-25 percent.
                  Therefore, along with reduction in compliance cost, exporters need to be made aware of the benefits of
                  FTAs.

        The two partners must resolve these issues to take full advantage of the FTA and create the potential RVCs which will
        ultimately benefit the MSMEs in both regions.

        D. Potential items of export to Laos in engineering and India’s position

        In engineering, India is the 10th-largest supplier to Laos. The major export items include electric machinery and
        equipment, and motor vehicle/cars. The two countries have a significantly high trade complementarity index of 77.7 in
        engineering which implies there is significant scope for intraregional trade. India’s share in Lao’s engineering imports,
        sector-wise, is listed here, giving an idea as to the areas where India needs to improve its share.

           VII.  CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN INDIA AND LAOS


        Laos is a part of India’s extended neighbourhood as only one country, Myanmar, separates Laos from India’s Northeast.
        The distance from the Laos border with Myanmar in the north to the Manipur border in India is less than 2000 km.

           A. Port connectivity

           As a landlocked country, Laos possesses no ports or harbours on the sea.

           B. Road connectivity

           India has already proposed to expand the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway to include Cambodia, Laos,
           and Vietnam.

           C. Air connectivity

           The Wattay International Airport is the biggest airport in Laos and serves Vientiane, the capital of the country. It
           also has large numbers of international routes offered by various Asian airlines and is well connected to all major
           Indian airports.


           VIII. INVESTMENT RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA


        India has supported the development of Laos by extending lines of credit for infrastructure projects in the fields of
        transmission lines, hydropower projects, conversion of diesel to electric driven pump sets, and irrigation projects.

        D. Potential items of export to Malaysia in engineering and India’s position


          In engineering, India is the 10th-largest supplier to Malaysia. The major export items include metals, auto components,
          machinery and parts, and automobiles. The two countries have a significantly high trade complementarity index1
          of around 60.7 in engineering which implies there is significant scope for intraregional trade. India’s share in
          Malaysia’s engineering imports, sector-wise, is listed here, giving an idea as to the areas where India needs to
          improve its share.]]></page><page Index="85"><![CDATA[Chapter 3

          VII.  CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN INDIA AND MALAYSIA


         A. Road connectivity

        India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway (IMTTH) is a cross-border transportation network being financed by the
        governments of India, Myanmar, and Thailand. Similarly, Mekong-India Economic Corridor (MIEC) involves integrating
        the four Mekong countries – Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam – with India. All these connectivity corridors
        are often termed as land bridges between South and Southeast Asia.


         B.  Port connectivity

        According to the UNCTAD connectivity index, Malaysia is the world’s fifth best connected country in terms of shipping
        line connectivity. Currently, Malaysia counts eight federal administrated ports – Port Klang, Port of Tanjung Pelepas,
        Johor Port, Penang Port, Bintulu Port, Malacca Port, Kuantan Port, and Kemaman Port. Port Klang is the largest and
        most important port in Malaysia. Meanwhile, the ports in Sabah and Sarawak are under the jurisdiction of the state

        governments of Sabah and Sarawak respectively.

           C.  Air connectivity

        Located around 45 km south of Kuala Lumpur city in Selangor, Kuala Lumpur International Airport is the prime
        international airport in Malaysia offering flight services to various destinations across the world. Also, one of the South
        East Asia’s main airports, this public airport is under the operation of Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad. Malaysia is
        connected to all major airports in India,

            u  From Mumbai it takes approximately 5 hours 05 minutes to reach Kuala Lumpur
            u  From Kolkata it takes approximately 5 hours 45 minutes to reach Kuala Lumpur

         u     From Delhi it takes approximately 5 hours 25 minutes to reach Kuala Lumpur


          VIII.  INVESTMENT RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA



        Malaysia continues to be the preferred investment destination for high value manufacturing and global services hub in
        Asia. Malaysia continues to attract quality investments with greater specialisation in electrical, electronics, machinery
        equipment, aerospace, and medical devices. Malaysia places emphasis on high-technology and continues to target
        global service centres, principal hub, healthcare, education, logistics, green technology and R&D.

        D. Potential items of export to Philippines in engineering and India’s position

        India is the 13th-largest exporter of engineering goods to the Philippines with around 2 percent share in the Philippines’
        global engineering imports. India’s major engineering items exported to Philippines include two and three wheelers,
        iron and steel and its products, auto components/parts, motor vehicle/cars, electric machinery and equipment. and
        industrial machinery among others.

        India’s trade complementarity index with respect to Philippines in engineering has been estimated at 65.2 percent,
        which is reflective of a high match in India’s export pattern of engineering goods to Philippines’ import pattern of those
        goods. Listed here is India’s share in Philippines’ engineering imports across different engineering segments/product
        groups that reflects India’s scope to enhance its exports.

           VI. INDIA’S TRADE RELATIONS WITH SINGAPORE


        Singapore is the largest trade partner of India among the ASEAN member nations and India is at present the 17th-
        largest supplier of engineering products to Singapore among all nations. India’s merchandise exports to Singapore
        jumped by over 45 percent and bilateral trade surged by over 80 percent between 2016 and 2019 before declining
        in 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic on economic activities. India’s engineering exports to Singapore almost
        doubled between 2016 and 2019 but then declined in 2020 following the pandemic. The illustrations show bilateral
        trade figures for the last five completed years.

        D. Potential items of export to Singapore in engineering and trade complementarity


        Singapore is the 4th-largest destination of India’s engineering exports across the globe. Major engineering product
        items exported to Singapore include electric machinery and equipment; aircrafts, spacecrafts and parts; aluminium
        and products made of aluminium; industrial machinery; and zinc products among others.


        India has a high trade complementarity index of 51.2 percent with Singapore that necessarily indicates significant
        scope for enhancing engineering trade as more than half of Indian engineering exports matches with the requirements
        (imports) of Singapore.


        India’s share in Singapore’s global engineering imports across potential sectors where substantial scope exists for
        higher exports are listed here.

          VIII.  INVESTMENT RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA


        Singapore is the second-largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow into India after Mauritius. Cumulative
        FDI inflow into India from Singapore between April 2020 and December 2020 was recorded at $113.39 billion that
        accounted for nearly 22 percent of India’s global FDI inflow till end-2020. However, Singapore replaced Mauritius to
        become the largest source of FDI for India on a yearly basis during the last three fiscal years.]]></page><page Index="117"><![CDATA[Chapter 3

                                                                                                            SINGAPORE







        India has Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) with Singapore and Mauritius separately that yield ‘zero’
        capital gains tax for foreign direct investors investing in India through these two countries. This advantage induced
        many leading global investors to invest in India through Singapore and Mauritius routes.


        Singapore, on the other hand, is one of the top destinations for Indian investments. As per the latest release of the
        Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India, India’s outward FDI to Singapore was $67.64 billion between January
        2008 and December 2019.

        About 9000 Indian companies are registered in Singapore. Six PSUs, nine Banks, India Tourism, CII, FICCI, Air India,
        Jet Airways have their offices in Singapore. DBS Bank announced the launch of its locally incorporated subsidiary, DBS
        Bank India (DBIL) in March 2019. On the other hand, more than 440 companies from Singapore are registered in India.
        Two Banks, Enterprise Singapore (ES), Economic Development Board (EDB), and Singapore Tourism Board have their
        offices in India.

                                     Connecting India with ASEAN








           4.1 INTRODUCTION



        Connectivity is a major area of convergence for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and India. It is
        important because it promotes trade, brings people closer, and integrates the economies. Improving connectivity is
        essential for a region’s prosperity, continued growth, and, most importantly, for poverty reduction. Improved connectivity
        lowers costs and increases reliability. It is of great importance for industrial transport and thus for production, cost
        effectiveness, and reliability of supply. India is the third country after Japan and China to initiate a dedicated meeting with
        the ASEAN Connectivity Coordinating Committee (ACCC). India currently is working with ASEAN on multiple connectivity
        projects, through land, water, and air.
        In 2010, the East Asia Summit (EAS) leaders adopted a comprehensive strategy for smart, sustainable, and inclusive
        growth. At the 17th ASEAN Summit in 2010, these leaders adopted the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity, which
        identifies key strategies and actions to enhance the region’s connectivity in three dimensions: physical, institutional, and
        people-to-people. It shows the way ahead for Asia in regional integration. Asia’s aim of single market depends on the
        existence of a seamless, flexible, and efficient logistics and transportation system. At present, the market is fragmented
        and is often an obstacle to free flow of goods and services, and the administrative or technical barriers in the market
        result in expensive mobility within Asia.


           4.2 NEED, BENEFITS OF ENHANCED CONNECTIVITY



        One of the major obstacles to the expansion of trade between India and ASEAN is the high cost of moving goods across
        borders. Improved connectivity would reduce trade costs, raise the country’s comparative advantage and trade flows,
        expand markets, reduce poverty, and enhance the country’s welfare and quality of life of its citizens. Multiple effective
        cross-border and national transport projects mean stronger ASEAN-India connectivity. An integrated connectivity would
        also provide substantial benefits to landlocked and small island countries of the region as well as to poor and small
        countries by giving them low-cost access to world markets. Better connectivity between India and ASEAN can infuse
        new dynamism in the region’s production network. Stronger production network would enhance trade and investment,
        and thereby deepen the East Asian integration process. To sustain the regional production network, we need to improve
        trade costs and the country’s comparative advantage in trade. The catalyst to a regional production network is lowering
        trade costs. ASEAN-India connectivity would help unlock the tremendous potential of the region by removing constraints]]></page><page Index="140"><![CDATA[138









        and bottlenecks to growth. At this very initial stage, the emerging regional physical overland connectivity architecture
        between India and ASEAN is showing two important features: first, national connectivity having regional implications such
        as Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC); and second, the regional connectivity showing regional (or international)
        implications such as Mekong-India Economic Corridor (MIEC),Trilateral Highway (TH) between India, Myanmar, and
        Thailand, along Asian Highway (AH) No.1, and Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project (KMTTP).


           4.3 MAJOR CONNECTIVITY PROJECTS



        In order to enhance the physical connectivity between India and ASEAN, various research sources suggested two major
        axes that could be promoted to enhance connectivity: the first is overland connectivity through India’s Northeast Region
        (NER); and the second, the multimodal connectivity through southern India, primarily through the Chennai-Ennore
        area. The prioritised projects from the list of key actions stipulated under the various regional cooperation projects –
        especially those that will have high and immediate impact on ASEAN-India connectivity – are listed here.

        under consideration. The MIEC involves the integration of four Mekong countries – Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand, and
        Cambodia – along with India, connecting Ho Chi Minh City, Dawei, Bangkok, and Phnom Penh with Chennai. The
        corridor will provide opportunities for the participant countries to develop infrastructure, enhance their economic base
        with the region, and especially reduce the transit distance between India and ASEAN countries.
        Giving substance to ASEAN-India relations through connectivity will gradually change the geopolitical landscape of
        this region. Exploring opportunities through connectivity projects will not only curb existing insurgencies, but also help
        India’s northeastern states to develop their economic potential and integrate with mainland India. These projects will
        also help India to remove physical impediments to trade with ASEAN countries and further integrate the two regions for
        better economic and security relations.]]></page><page Index="142"><![CDATA[140









           4.4  IMT TRILATERAL HIGHWAY



        The India-Myanmar-Thailand-Trilateral Highway is a highway currently under construction as part of India’s Look East
        Policy. Upon its completion, it will connect Moreh in India with Mae Sot in Thailand via Myanmar. By linking other
        highways in other East Asian countries such as Vietnam and Laos, it is believed this project will boost economic growth
        in the region.
          4.4.1 Background

        The trilateral highway was first proposed during a ministerial meeting in Yangon in April 2002. The approximate length
        of the highway is 1360 km. The 160-km-long India-Myanmar Friendship Road linking Moreh-Tamu-Kalmeya-Kalewa
        forms part of the trilateral highway. Having been built by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), it was inaugurated on
        13 February 2001. The BRO maintained it until 2009 when full ownership was transferred to Myanmar. Regarding the
        Friendship Road project, it was initially agreed between India and Myanmar that the Indian government would widen the
        existing roads in the area while Myanmar would upgrade single-lane bridges in the route. But the Myanmar government
        failed to do so. In May 2012, it was announced that India would repair the existing roads and as well as the 71 bridges
        in the region around the Friendship Road project.

        During Myanmar President U Htin Kyaw’s state visit to India in August 2016, an MoU was signed with the Government
        of India under which the latter will fund the construction of 69 bridges, including approach roads in the Tamu-Kyigone-
        Kalewa section (149.7 km). India provided funding for the renovation of 73 bridges along the route in Myanmar that
        were originally built during World War II. On February 2017, Myanmar accepted a proposal from the Thai government
        to repair a 68-km road between Mon State and Ein Du in Kayin State. This repair will be funded by Thailand at a cost
        of $51 million. Myanmar also requested assistance repairing other sections of the road In May 2017, it was proposed
        by the NITI Aayog to establish a special purpose vehicle involving all three countries to closely monitor the project. India
        and ASEAN have plans to extend the trilateral highway route to Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam as this connectivity will
        generate annually, an estimated $70 billion in incremental GDP and 20 million in incremental aggregate employment
        by 2025.

          4.4.2  Travel arrangements in trilateral highway
        A motor vehicles Agreement along with protocols for regulating and facilitating the movement of cargo and passenger
        vehicular traffic is under inter-governmental negotiations between India, Myanmar, and Thailand. India initiated a
        preliminary survey to determine the feasibility of establishing a rail link parallel to the trilateral highway in January
        2018. Japan expressed interest in collaborating with India and funding the proposed rail link.]]></page><page Index="143"><![CDATA[Chapter 4

                                                               issues



           4.5  MODES OF CONNECTIVITY


          4.5.1 Road

        One of the flagship projects for land connectivity between ASEAN and India is the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral
        Highway. This initiative, which connects the three countries from Moreh in India, to Mae Sot in Thailand, to Bagan in
        Myanmar, was first proposed in 2002. Besides this, the India, Myanmar, and Thailand Motor Vehicles Agreement (IMT
        MVA) is in the final stage. On realisation, this will become the first-ever cross-border facilitation agreement between
        South and Southeast Asia, thus allowing free movement of cargo, passenger, and personal vehicles along the roads
        linking these three countries. ASEAN countries and India have to identify the missing links and investment needs from a
        region-wide perspective. To a great extent, missing roadways in Myanmar is hindering the overland connectivity between
        India and ASEAN. Therefore, Myanmar’s average road conditions need to be improved. For efficient movement of larger
        vehicles, roads leading from Myanmar to India and Thailand need to be widened and maintained properly. Development
        of economic corridors connecting countries in the region will facilitate investments as well as spur economic growth
        of India’s southern and northeastern regions as well as of Myanmar and Mekong. The proposed connectivity between
        ASEAN and India would throw many challenges for its development. The link would open considerable avenues and
        opportunities for trade between the regions.]]></page><page Index="144"><![CDATA[142








          4.5.2  Maritime

        To develop connectivity through water, ASEAN and India are working on the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport
        Project (KMMTTP). The project was initiated by the Indian government in 2008 and is entirely funded by India. The
        purpose is to seek an alternative route through Myanmar for the transportation of goods to the northeast region of India.
        The KMMTTP connects Kolkata in India to Sittwe and Paletwa in Myanmar by sea and river respectively. A road is also
        planned to connect Paletwa in Myanmar to Zorinpui on the India-Myanmar border.

        Alongside this initiative, India has contributed to build a sea link via Sittwe port in Myanmar in order to enable an
        alternative transit route through Bangladesh. Since ports and waterways are responsible for the flow of the merchandise
        trade between ASEAN and India, investment in quality infrastructure is essential for better connectivity, trade growth,
        and maximum utility of resources. Indian ports are heading for a better future with growing international trade. Thus,
        operational efficiency of the ports have to be competitive and on par with the best ports in the world. Modern cargo
        handling techniques must be introduced to improve port performance. Efforts must be made to enhance the quality of
        service and productivity levels.

          4.5.3 Air
        While upgradation of the Chennai and Kolkata airports (both domestic and international terminals) is in progress, it is
        essential to have second airports for both these cities. On the issue of air connectivity, select ASEAN countries have
        direct flights to first- and second-tier cities in India, but there is ample scope for improvement. India in the past had
        announced a line of credit of $1 billion to encourage such connectivity projects between India and ASEAN, and a Project
        Development Fund of Rs5 billion ($78 million) with an aim to promote manufacturing hubs in the CLMV countries.

          4.5.4  Rail

        In the context of Indian Railways, technological upgradation and modernisation of the current assets is essential for
        realising maximum benefits. Timely completion of the western and eastern DFCs would provide significant boost to
        economic development in the region and bring confidence for planning of other DFCs along the trunk routes. Plans for
        Chennai-Bangalore-Mumbai Industrial Corridor must be evolved by closely studying best practices from DMIC project
        and similar projects developed elsewhere in the world.]]></page><page Index="145"><![CDATA[Chapter 4









           4.6  CHALLENGES TO INDIA-ASEAN CONNECTIVITY



        The challenges that need to be addressed in the region include, to mention a few, poor quality of roads and incomplete
        road networks, missing links in road and railways, and inadequate maritime and aviation infrastructure. In the rail
        sector, track gauges, voltages, and signalling systems differ from one country to another. Similarly, in the road sector,
        highway lanes, lighting system, and quality of roads differ across countries in Asia. The port facilities in some countries
        are well equipped with technical and electronic equipment, whereas in many countries of the region ports still belong to
        the ancient period and are far away from automation and modernisation. While runways in some airports accommodate
        bigger airplanes, most of the Asian airports lack basic aviation infrastructure. To create a functional single market in
        Asia, it is necessary to overcome the missing links in transportation, the lack of interoperability, and infrastructure gaps
        reducing the efficiency and weakening the global competitiveness of the Asian industry.
        India-ASEAN free trade agreement (FTA) is central to India’s growing engagement with her eastern neighbours.
        Accompanying this growth will be an increase in the demand of national and international infrastructure, for both
        production and consumption, and for international trade purposes. Undoubtedly, failure to respond to this demand
        will slow down India’s trade and hamper the growth process. Therefore, infrastructure challenges require a better
        understanding and adequate support.


           4.7 INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING FOR ENHANCED CONNECTIVITY



        Funding requirement for infrastructure is huge and a considerable amount of future investment is expected to come
        from the private sector. So far, response from the private sector has been good. However, efforts to enable level playing
        field to the private entrepreneur by fair allocation of risks is highly essential. In this regard, greater economic and/or
        commercial cooperation is desired from those developed and developing countries that have technological expertise
        on transport and communications.

        In order to fund the large infrastructure investments required to boost ASEAN-India connectivity, the region needs to
        further develop mechanisms for the financial intermediation between its large savings and its equally large investment
        needs. The region should support expanding the use of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for investment in infrastructure
        and creation of a large regional infrastructure development fund to channel its foreign exchange reserves into much
        needed infrastructure investments.



           4.8  BOON FOR NORTHEAST AND CHENNAI


        Enhancing connectivity between India and ASEAN is a multifaceted task and requires implementing strong policy
        initiatives. Development of this connectivity would open significant opportunities for industrial development in India and
        its trade potential with South and East Asian countries. Chennai has already established itself as a gateway to southern
        India. This connectivity would link the Chennai region to the rest of the world through its maritime infrastructure. Thus,]]></page><page Index="146"><![CDATA[144








        Chennai has a great potential of becoming the greater gateway for India and function as a core node providing centre
        of business activities with industrial clusters and work as an engine to promote regional economic growth.

        At the same time, with greater connectivity, NER will be better integrated with the markets of neighbouring countries.
        Cross-border trade and investment flow and cross-border development cooperation will open up new avenues for
        growth and development. Private investment will be encouraged to cash in on the cross-border synergies. ASEAN-India
        connectivity will be beneficial for the people living across the borders in both the countries.

        A two-pronged strategy of development may help the NER to overcome the drawbacks of landlockedness. First,
        because NER shares 96% of its borders with the neighbouring countries of Bhutan, Bangladesh, China, and Myanmar,
        it is important to link the region with the Southeast Asian as well as South Asian markets. Second, restoration of
        NER’s traditional routes by way of transit and transhipment corridors through Bangladesh for movement of goods and
        passengers can address the adverse geographical condition and ensure speedy development of NER. However, for
        both the options, the obstacles to physical connectivity as well as non-physical institutional arrangements between
        the region and the ASEAN countries on the one hand and between the region and Bangladesh on the other need to be
        addressed expeditiously.



           4.9  WAY FORWARD


        Once the cross-border connectivity improves, cross-border trade and development cooperation would be promoted.
        Border trade may be viewed as a strategic tool for the long-term development of the frontier areas. An improved
        infrastructure between India and ASEAN will be insufficient to foster the regional integration until and unless it is
        widely complemented by appropriate policies and regulations as well as participation of the private sector. We need
        policies and regulations to foster an effective cross-border movement of goods, services, and people. Harmonising and
        simplifying the customs procedures, information sharing, customs modernisation, establishing transparent transit rules,
        and improving logistics in general are also critical to infrastructure expansion.

        Enhancing connectivity requires stronger regional institutions to build and manage the cross-border infrastructure.
        Trade liberalisation is important but sometimes is not adequate to enhance a country’s trade. Improved connectivity
        and trade facilitation can complement that effort. It is the way forward for the regional trade and economic partnership
        between India and ASEAN. The desired outcomes emanating from this report would be to facilitate the deepening and
        widening of the production and distribution networks between India and ASEAN. Equally important, enhanced ASEAN-
        India connectivity will narrow the development gaps and lead to increased opportunities for greater investment, trade,
        growth, and employment. Finally, deeper intraregional economic linkages and people-to-people interactions between
        ASEAN and India will eventually contribute towards the achievement of an integrated Asian community.]]></page><page Index="147"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="148"><![CDATA[146

                       Role of engineering MSMEs in strengthening

                          India-ASEAN regional production network






           5.1 INTRODUCTION


        It is now a well-recognised fact across the globe that micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) play a vital role
        in the development process of an economy, especially in the developing and emerging economies. Despite several
        shortcomings, a well-built and resilient MSME sector is critical to sustainable economic growth of a country. Both
        manufacturing and services sectors in an emerging nation rely much on the performances of their MSMEs in order to
        achieve a significant contribution in economic development of the nation. In this chapter, we will discuss the contribution
        of the MSME sector in the economic development of India as well as in the ASEAN nations and will analyse the
        opportunities left for the MSMEs in the engineering sectors of both sides with strengthening bilateral economic relations
        between India and ASEAN.]]></page><page Index="149"><![CDATA[Chapter 5








            5.2  MSME SECTOR AS BACKBONE OF INDIAN ECONOMY



        The importance of the MSME sector in the process of development of the Indian economy has been increasing so
        rapidly that the sector is now called the backbone of the Indian economy. The contribution of the MSME sector to India’s
        GDP has increased from 29.3% in 2014-15 to 30.27% in 2018-19. The contribution of manufacturing MSMEs in the
        country’s total manufacturing GVO (gross value of output) at current prices has remained constant at around 33%, i.e.
        one-third during the period 2014-15 to 2018-19, while the contribution of manufacturing GDP is accounted at around
        8% of GDP. After agriculture, MSME is the second-largest employment generating sector in India with creation of 11.1
        crore jobs across India where 32% have been created in manufacturing. The contribution of MSMEs in Indian exports
        is around 40% at present.

          5.2.1 Definition

        In India, a firm where investment in plant and machinery or equipment does not exceed Rs1 crore and turnover does not
        exceed Rs5 crore is called a micro enterprise while in case of a small enterprise, the investment in plant and machinery
        or equipment should be Rs10 crore or less and turnover Rs50 crore or less. For a medium enterprise, the investment
        in plant and machinery or equipment should not exceed Rs50 crore and turnover should not exceed Rs250 crore.

          5.2.2  MSME in Indian engineering segment

        India’s engineering sector has seen remarkable performance in recent years before being impacted by the pandemic.
        Indian engineering exports achieved its record high three times between 2014-15 and 2018-19 with an all-time-high
        record of $81 billion in 2018-19. As mentioned earlier, the MSME sector contributes around 40% to India’s overseas
        shipments, and it can easily be concluded that a vibrant MSME sector has led the growth of engineering.

        In India, engineering accounts for nearly 30% of manufacturing production and contributes to around one-fourth in
        India’s merchandise exports. The importance of the MSME lies in the procedure of setting production linkage with the
        large-scale firms especially in the manufacturing sector, including engineering. In the case of exports also, MSMEs are
        the integral part of the supply chain. Considering the contribution of MSMEs to manufacturing, exports, and employment,
        other sectors are also benefitting from it. MNCs are buying semi-finished and auxiliary products from small enterprises
        in almost all segments across engineering, which is helpful in creating a linkage between MSME and big companies.
        That’s why this sector is called the growth-engine of the economy.
        Recognising the indispensability of the MSME sector in economic advancement, the Government of India has been
        continuously trying to improve this sector so that it can response its best to the nation’s need. Unique initiatives of the
        government like Make in India, Digital India, etc have opened the doors for the Indian MSME sector to participate more
        in the production process and get integrated in the global value chain.

          5.2.3 Pivotal role of MSME sector in ASEAN economic development

        Like India, the economy of ASEAN is also greatly supported by the MSME sector in stimulating domestic demand,
        creating employment, promoting innovation, and building healthy competition to fuel the pace of economic activities. As
        per the information published in Asia-SME-Monitor 2020 based on National Firm Classification, MSMEs in Southeast]]></page><page Index="150"><![CDATA[148









        Asia accounted for an average 97.2% of all enterprises, 69.4% of the total workforce, and 41.1% of a country’s GDP
        during 2010-19. MSMEs contributed 20.4% of a country’s export value on average during 2010-18.
        Development of the MSME sector has been a policy priority for governments across all ASEAN nations as they seek
        economic diversification and inclusive growth. Most countries in this region have long-term strategies for development
        of MSMEs in line with their broader national economic development strategies and goals. In this context, it is mention-
        worthy that all the 10 ASEAN -nations together formed the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2015 to accelerate
        regional  economic integration. The AEC holds  the ASEAN  Coordinating Committee on Micro, Small  and Medium
        Enterprises and the Working Committee on Financial Inclusion to promote MSME development and financial inclusion
        in the region, respectively. ASEAN’s long-term MSME development strategy for 2016-25 has five major objectives:

            •  promoting productivity, technology, and innovation;
            •  increasing access to finance;

            •  enhancing market access and internationalisation;

            •  consolidating the policy and regulatory environment; and
            •  promoting entrepreneurship and human capital development.

          5.2.4 Opportunities for engineering MSMEs of India and ASEAN

        Our discussion so far has pointed out two important aspects of MSMEs in India and ASEAN. The MSME sector in both
        the regions have noteworthy contribution in the process of economic development of their respective regions and
        engineering MSMEs of both regions are well equipped to take advantage of the India-ASEAN integration process,
        especially in the engineering sector, by forming regional production networks and by participating more in regional
        value chain.

          5.2.5  Integrating engineering MSMEs of India and ASEAN
        India has a suitable policy regime in place for its MSME sector while the incumbent government has brought several
        unique initiatives like Make in India that encourage more participation of MSMEs. Some 25 segments of manufacturing
        have been selected for this first-of-its-kind initiative ensuring vast scope for the MSMEs to engage in the production
        process. On one hand, the scheme invites leading global players to set up their production units in India, and on the
        other, it extends the scope for Indian MSMEs to get integrated with their ASEAN counterparts.

        Now, the ASEAN region is one of the highest contributors in the global value chain (GVC). However, the advent of
        the Covid pandemic has underlined the limitations of GVC by causing disruption in global supply chains across the
        globe. The importance of the regional value chain (RVC) has become prominent before the policymakers as well as for
        businesses. For India, being connected with the ASEAN region through its strategically important CLMV sub-region and
        with ASEAN countries offering an important market for Indian products, it is a very good opportunity to complement
        its Make in India campaign. The opportunities for developing regional production networks and building RVCs through
        integration of MSMEs of India and the ASEAN extends to almost all segments of engineering with special mention to
        parts and components that will be discussed later in this chapter.]]></page><page Index="151"><![CDATA[Chapter 5








        The policies of ASEAN member-nations of promoting internationalisation for MSMEs through assisting their participation
        in global value chains to unlock new productivity and inclusive growth brings good opportunity for Indian MSMEs to
        participate in India-ASEAN RVCs. Thailand has developed specific industrial clusters in auto and auto parts, electronics,
        digital industries, etc as high potential production bases providing more global business opportunities for MSMEs.
        Malaysia has advocated a series of initiatives to promote internationalisation of MSMEs, namely SME Go Global, Market
        Development Grant, and export training programmes. In Vietnam, MSME internationalisation has been set as a policy
        target, where the government offers export training and connects domestic MSMEs with global supply chains through
        trade promotion activities.


          5.2.6  Linking ASEAN through Greater Mekong Sub-region
        The Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) in the ASEAN, comprising Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Thailand
        can well be a gateway for Indian MSMEs to integrate more with their ASEAN counterparts as its geographical proximity
        to India provides the necessary connectivity to enter into the ASEAN market. Moreover, India’s low penetration in the
        market of GMS and offering of a series of engineering products by the ASEAN provides enough reason for India to
        access the market of this region as a strategic entry point for deepening of its engineering network with ASEAN.

        A study by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) reveals that the MSME sector has to play a key role in India’s integration
        strategy with the GMS. Helping SMEs break into this market can provide India access to value chains and marketing
        networks throughout the sub-region and beyond. Furthermore, some recent initiatives like East Coast Economic Corridor,
        promoting the integration of India’s industrial clusters with value chains extending to Southeast Asia and East Asia;
        the Eastern Economic Corridor in Thailand; the Greater Mekong Sub-region’s Southern Economic Corridor traversing
        Cambodia and Thailand; Mekong-Ganga pact; the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multisectoral, Technical, and Economic
        Cooperation; and agreements with ASEAN has opened new windows of opportunity for strengthening India’s ties with
        the GMS and hence ASEAN in turn.]]></page><page Index="152"><![CDATA[150








        The MSME sector is the backbone of the Indian as well as the Mekong economies. Indian SMEs are more likely than
        larger firms to enter the smaller Mekong markets, which they can use as a gateway for expanding into larger, more
        complex markets of ASEAN. Mekong countries offer many opportunities for them, particularly in sectors that are more
        integrated with global markets, such as auto components, parts and components of industrial and electrical machineries,
        garments, and pharmaceuticals. However, adequate government support is required from both sides to carry out the
        process of integration of MSMEs successfully and to help both India and ASEAN securing higher participation in RVCs.

        In the next section we briefly look into a case study on the MSME policy of Vietnam, a country within the Mekong region
        which has increasingly gained in importance in the global value chains.


           5.3  CASE STUDY



           Evolution of MSMEs in Vietnam and collaboration with Indian MSMEs

        As per an OECD study conducted in 2016, the rapid growth of Vietnam in the last decade was clearly attributed to rapid
        industrialisation in the country. MSMEs are a large participant of the industrialisation process in Vietnam, accounting
        for 96% of the country’s total stock of companies, 47% of employment, and 36% of national value-added. The MSME
        sector in Vietnam took off since the economic reforms in 1986, which promoted free market incentives along with
        proper government planning. The OECD study adds that the Vietnamese MSMEs are innovative in terms of products
        as well as process. The innovation capability of the country took off since the establishment of the National Technology
        Innovation Fund, 2014 and the Vietnam Inclusive Innovation Project, 2013, aimed at improving the technological and
        innovative capabilities of MSMEs.

        Vietnam is a largely export-driven economy with significant participation in global value chains. The share of FDI
        in Vietnam’s exports is almost 70%. A favourable investment climate and a large pool of low-cost labour are the
        main factors behind making Vietnam a sought-after GVC location. Another factor that largely contributed to Vietnam’s
        attraction is its proximity to large Asian manufacturing powerhouses such as China, Japan, and Korea. Improved
        connectivity of Vietnam within ASEAN and with these countries has also played a major role.
        However, while increasing participation in the GVC is a positive trend, Vietnam’s exports are mainly driven by foreign-
        owned small companies. Hence the foreign value-added content in Vietnam’s exports is larger than that of the domestic
        value-added content. As per a recent ADB study involving the OECD TiVA (Trade in Value Database), the share of foreign
        value-added exports in Vietnam’s manufacturing trade remained at around 45% from 2007 to 2015. The sectors with
        significant presence of foreign value-added exports include fabricated metal products and machinery and equipment.
        However there has been not much improvement in domestic value-added exports. The country is highly integrated
        in GVCs but the participation is mostly in low-value-added products. There are several factors behind this, the most
        prominent being the lack of skill. While large numbers of semi- and unskilled labourers are important for increasing GVC
        participation, skilled labourers are required for upgrading one’s participation in the value chain.

        Like Vietnam, India is also regarded as a strong contender to participate in GVCs but is plagued by similar issues which
        limit its participation. The two countries can gain by sharing their success stories, expertise, and technical skills and]]></page><page Index="153"><![CDATA[Chapter 5








        upgrade their individual GVIC participation. Keeping these factors in mind India and Vietnam signed an MoU in 2013
        that aimed at determining key thrust areas of cooperation and opportunities and put in place an institutional framework
        for the MSMEs of the two countries. More such cooperation initiatives should be undertaken by the governments of the
        two countries to deliver maximum benefits to their MSMEs in terms of participation in GVCs.



           5.4 CONCLUSION


        When the global economy is reshaping and all developed as well as emerging economies have been playing all-out to
        restore the international demand-supply chains, the time is apt for India to strengthen its relations with strategically
        important partners like ASEAN. With engineering sharing around one-fourth of total merchandise exports of both India
        and the ASEAN and MSME sector accounts for nearly 40% of India’s exports, deepening of economic ties will surely
        bring sizeable opportunity for Indian engineering firms, especially its MSMEs, to build a solid regional production
        network with their counterparts in ASEAN.

                        India-ASEAN Partnership in Technology and

                               Opportunities for Engineering Sector





           6.1  INTRODUCTION


        India and the ASEAN countries have a remarkable history of mutual collaboration and cooperation for more than
        three decades with a shared vision of economic growth and regional peace and prosperity. India and ASEAN have
        achieved major milestones through various successful initiatives that have facilitated the smooth movement of goods
        and services. Both India and ASEAN present tremendous trade and investment opportunities for investors from across
        the globe, across multiple sectors due to their robust growth trajectories. India and ASEAN countries are expanding
        their collaboration in new areas such as Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing which is likely to have far-reaching
        implications for their economic and social development. Against this backdrop, this chapter analyses the India and
        ASEAN partnership in emerging technologies and potential scope for collaboration particularly in the engineering sector.


           6.2  HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF INDIA-ASEAN TECHNOLOGY PARTNERSHIP



        India and the ASEAN countries began Science and Technology (S&T) collaboration in 1996 with the formation of
        the ASEAN-India S&T working Group (AIWGST). In its initial phase, ASEAN-India S&T collaboration was financed and
        supported by the ASEAN-India Fund (AIF). Recognising the importance of S&T collaboration in shaping India ASEAN
        economic ties, the Government of India created a dedicated fund – the ASEAN-India S&T Development Fund (AISTDF)
        – in 2008. This fund is aimed to support research and development projects and other development projects between
        India and the ASEAN countries. The total budget under the AISTDF was $5 million which was jointly contributed by the
        Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and the Department of Science & Technology (DST). The objectives of India and ASEAN
        S&T collaboration are based on three important pillars:
                •    Encourage  and  promote  cooperation  in  science,  technology,  and  innovation,  including through joint
                     research activity; and development on cross-sectoral areas such as health, communicable and emerging
                     infectious diseases, environmental management, climate change adaptation and mitigation measures,
                     agricultural technologies, alternative energy, biodiversity, food processing, advanced materials for the
                     development of value-added products, and space technology and applications;

                •    Encourage and promote cooperation in biotechnology including through capacity building and joint
                     research and development for mutual benefit;
                •    Undertake activities and develop programmes/projects under the ASEAN-India Science and Technology
                     Development Fund.]]></page><page Index="156"><![CDATA[154









           6.3  GROWTH TRAJECTORIES OF INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION



        The Industrial Revolution kicked off with steam and the first machines that automated some of the work that our
        progenitors did. This was followed by the second era of the industrial revolution in which the introduction of electricity,
        assembly lines, and the birth of mass production were a key force for industrial development; and then the third-
        generation industry began with the introduction of computers and the beginning of automation when robots and
        machines began to replace workers on those assembly lines.
        Today, the world has entered the era of Industry 4.0 in which computers and automation are introducing massive
        disruption in the industrial ecosystem. This is further shaped by the rise of robotics connected with computer systems
        equipped with machine learning algorithms that manage robotics with minimum human intervention. It is important
        to state that Industry 4.0 is characterised by highly sophisticated and intelligent, interconnected systems that form a
        fully technology-driven value chain. It is built on cyber-physical production systems, which integrate communications,
        information technology, data, and physical eleme nts to transform traditional plants into smart manufacturing. The key
        objective is that machines interact with other machines and products and information is processed and delivered in
        real-time, which will have far-reaching implications to the whole industrial ecosystem.]]></page><page Index="157"><![CDATA[Chapter 6








        Industry 4.0 is all about creating smart, innovative, and flexible digital supply chains, manufacturing plants, and
        distribution models in which advanced computerised machines collect and transmit data through machine-to-machine
        communication and to human operators. This is largely aimed at helping institutions to make quicker, smarter decisions,
        all while reducing costs. The industrial revolution 4.0 will have tremendous impact on the global economic system
        and it will help firms to accumulate and evaluate all valuable data through machines, big data analytics, and artificial
        intelligence, which will introduce efficient production techniques to generate superior quality goods at affordable prices.
        Other than this, it will also increase productivity, shift economic science, lead to higher industrial growth, and transform
        the profile of personnel – eventually changing the competing companies and regions. The global adoption of Industry
        4.0 might lead to other initiatives and cooperative efforts.. Broadly, there are nine technological factors that progressively
        lay the foundation of Industry 4.0 and future industrialisation. These are: autonomous robots, big data, augmented
        reality (AR), additive manufacturing, cloud computing, cyber security, IoT, system integration, and simulation.

        India and the ASEAN countries recognise the need and importance of Industry 4.0 in their next phase of industrial
        transformation that will be driven by advanced technologies. They have undertaken several measures, both at policy
        and institutional levels, to encourage industry to adopt new technologies in manufacturing operations. The GOI have
        announced several initiatives such as Digital India, Skill India, Smart Advanced Manufacturing and Rapid Transformation
        Hub (SAMARTH), Technology Centres, Technology Upgradation Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar, and
        Make in India. These initiatives make for Industry 4.0 implementation with an aim to advance technological solutions
        to Indian manufacturing units by 2025 through steps like awareness programme, training, demo centres etc. It is also
        aimed at promoting greater adoption of digital technologies in day-to-day life and industrial structure to boost the
        productivity and competitiveness of the economy to double the country’s digital economy.

        The GoI has created an institutional infrastructure to address challenges encountered by the Indian industry that
        undermine its global competitiveness such as the perception of low quality, skill and knowledge gap, low volume of
        production, stiff competition on cost from other nations, low levels of innovation, and limited ability to meet rapidly
        changing customer needs and expectations. It has established the Centre for Industry 4.0 (C4i4) Lab Pune, Central
        Manufacturing Technology Institute, Centre of Excellence in Advanced Manufacturing Technology, IIT Kharagpur. The
        overarching goal of these institutions is support domestic industries to adopt Industry 4.0-driven technologies to become
        competitive in the global market. Many Indian companies are working in this direction and have made substantial
        progress. In the automobile sector, companies such as Maruti Suzuki, Ford Motors, Mahindra, and Hyundai have
        implemented the automation process in their plants by using robots on the assembly lines. Bosch India has started the
        implementation of smart manufacturing at its 15 manufacturing centres in India which uses real-time data to shorten
        throughput times for the calibration of pumps for tractors.

        Similarly, the ASEAN group of countries have taken initiatives both in national and regional contexts to leverage]]></page><page Index="159"><![CDATA[________________________________________________________________

        the potential benefits of Industry 4.0. At a regional level, ASEAN countries adopted the ASEAN Work Programme
        on Electronic Commerce 2017-2025 in 2017 and inked the ASEAN Agreement on Electronic Commerce in 2018.
        This work programme is further expanded into the ASEAN Digital Integration Framework Action Plan (DIFAP) 2019-
        2025, which has identified five priority areas to address the critical barriers and accelerate existing ASEAN platforms
        and plans to realise digital integration. These are: digital connectivity and affordable access; financial ecosystem;
        commerce and trade; workforce transformation; and business ecosystem. At the national level, ASEAN countries have
        introduced policies about Industry 4.0. Malaysia launched the Industry4ward policy that focuses on incentivising the
        industry to adopt the Industry 4.0 technologies related to automation and modernisation. Indonesia has come up with a
        comprehensive policy Making Indonesia 4.0 which underscores the importance of enhancing efficiency and productivity
        of the local enterprises through advanced technologies to improve their business competitiveness both in the regional
        and global markets. The adoption of advanced technologies led by Industry 4.0 is far more manufacturing-based
        economies such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam to remain competitive in regional and global value chains.

        The importance of Industry 4.0 can be easily assessed from the fact of how firms are adopting digital technologies in
        their value chains. A McKinsey survey of more than 200 business leaders throughout the 10 countries that form the
        ASEAN clearly confirmed the tremendous potential of Industry 4.0. A majority of them have confirmed that Industry 4.0
        will introduce new business models to their industries, which will help firms to improve their productivity, performance,
        and competitiveness, which is critical for them to move up on value chains. Firms based in ASEAN countries are of the
        view that if they have to sustain in the era of smart manufacturing, they have to step up with massive investment. The
        global technology firms are setting up their technology centres in ASEAN countries to become key suppliers of smart
        technologies. Hexagon AB has set up a Hexagon Smart Manufacturing Innovation Centre in Singapore to provides
        solutions for design and engineering, production and metrology to make manufacturing smarter.

          6.3.4  Strengthening collaboration in Industry 4.0 and smart technologies


          India and ASEAN countries recognise that the fourth industrial revolution demands greater cooperation and synergies
        to facilitate structural transformation and economic diversification. There is need to promote collaboration in Industry 4.0
        and smart technologies to improve industrial productivity and competitiveness. During the India-ASEAN Commemorative
        Summit 2018 Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed the importance of information technology cooperation to shape
        India and ASEAN relations and focused on fostering a new area of technology partnership through a regional high-
        capacity fibre-optic network that would integrate rural areas of two regions. Recognising the complementarities in
        bilateral trade and investment, India and ASEAN can cooperate in capacity building, research and development, critical
        information infrastructure, 5G, internet of things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI), among others.



             6.4  POTENTIAL AREAS OF COLLABORATION IN THE ENGINEERING SECTOR


          India and ASEAN countries can encourage their innovative start-ups in the engineering sector to form a consortium
        to develop the platform in emerging technologies that are critical for boosting productivity of engineering firms. This
        would help India and ASEAN to enhance trade and investment flows and reduce impediments for MSMEs to join global
        value chains.]]></page><page Index="162"><![CDATA[160








          •   India and ASEAN countries have strong regional value chain linkages in automobile sectors where India is a supplier
               of automotive components and also importer of intermediate inputs for its downstream automobile manufacturing.
               Considering the fact that the automobile sector is going through massive disruption due to new technologies
               both in India and ASEAN, there exist significant scope for collaboration for India and ASEAN automotive companies
               to work together in critical areas manufacturing of such engine design, battery manufacturing among others.

          •   India and ASEAN can foster strong partnership in agri- technologies to transform the agriculture value chain by
               connecting farmers to markets and shared equipment, automating farm management processes, critical data
               analysis to provide action oriented insights for farmers. Affordable access to real time information and data from
               different sources can enable companies to offer customised inputs to farmers, to enhance productivity.

          •   The collaboration between India and ASEAN countries needs to be strengthened by expanding the scope of
               the ASEAN-India Innovation Platform. It should allow sector-specific institutions to partner product with institutions
               in ASEAN to facilitate development, transfer, and innovate low-cost technologies. Institutions such as EEPC India,
               SIAM, and ACMA can be important partners in the ASEAN-India Innovation Platform, given their sectoral
               competence.

          •   The rapid expansion of digital technologies and their application in manufacturing operations make it abundantly
               clear that the new technologies will be the key driver of future manufacturing both in India and ASEAN. It is
               therefore, important for India and ASEAN countries to build greater synergies between Digital India, Make in
               India, ASEAN Digital Integration Framework Action Plan, and national policies pertaining to Industry 4.0 and
               smart-related policies to ensure that gains from digital transformation are evenly distributed across the
               manufacturing value chain.]]></page><page Index="163"><![CDATA[Chapter 6

                                 Conclusion and the Way Forward









        The Asian economies have experienced significant growth in recent years. Even as the world economy is being ravaged
        by the Covid19 pandemic, many Asian economies have exhibited resilience and are expected to recover from the global
        recession at a faster pace. These robust performances of Asian economies have encouraged intra-Asian trade and
        cooperation to a large extent. Several studies conducted by the IMF and UNCTAD in 2008 indicated the intra-Asian
        trade as the major factor behind the boom in Asian exports and growth in South-South trade.
        Therefore in this context, India’s relations with the ASEAN countries hold significant importance. The discussions in
        the earlier chapters indicate that the relations have strengthened in the last decade to a large extent. Still, there is
        significant untapped potential in several areas of bilateral cooperation, which, if addressed properly, could transform
        the region into a strong trade bloc.

        Some of the key areas of cooperation as concluded from the earlier chapters are:



          Key areas of cooperation                    Action taken/proposed




          Strengthening trade and investment ties     •  Addressing bilateral trade issues and non-tariff barriers
